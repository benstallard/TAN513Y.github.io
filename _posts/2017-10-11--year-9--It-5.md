    <td>Today was a good lesson. The lesson started with everyone getting told for the 1000 time not to say 'um' or ‘urgh’ but I still do it, I need to work out how to um keep not saying um!. This lesson, we had to create discount codes. This was hard at first because I had to remember my vlookup. However, when I Refreshed my mind it became easier.Perseverance was really helpful as I kept trying the work I put in eventually paid off. I was extremely happy when it showed me the percentage for my discount code on the order form. We were mainly working on solely the Discount Codes today. </td>
