    <td>Today was an easy lesson. Today we had a cover and we were set work to have done the enciphering on our spreadsheets which I had already done. So instead I added in the deciphering which was fairly similar to the previous vlookup but just a bit different. I managed to do that fairly quickly then I moved on to using thing such as semi colons, brackets and other things like that in my encryption it worked at first but when I did it as a letter was a { it just came up as a blank box. I will try to work it out.Overall a good lesson.</td>
