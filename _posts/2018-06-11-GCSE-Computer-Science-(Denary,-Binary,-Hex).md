    <td>To convert from hex to denary via binary.Separate the hex digits into 2 and D and find the equivalent binary numbers (2 = 0010; D = 1101)(Split into nibbles)
Piece them together to get 00101101 (0x128 + 0x64 + 1x32 + 0x16 + 1x8 + 1x4 + 0x2 + 1x1 = 45 in denary).
 To convert denary to binary
Set up the columns of base 2 numbers
Find the highest 2n number that goes into 84. The highest 2n number is 26 = 64
84 â€“ 64 = 20. Find the highest 2n number that goes into 20. The highest 2n number is 24 = 16
20 - 16 = 4. Find the highest 2n number that goes into 4. The highest 2n number is 22 = 4
4 - 4 = 0
Mark up the columns of base 2 numbers with a 1 where the number has been the highest 2n number, or with a 0:
