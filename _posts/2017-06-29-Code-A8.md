    <td>Today I made sure that I read through the descriptions and instructions precisely.Today I worked effectively with my partners, Jack and charlie.. We worked efficiently by helping each other and therefore got quite far into the next section, 'a day at the supermarket'. Like last week, reading the instructions and information helped me understand what I was meant to be doing. This helped me get the coding correct and therefore get more done in the lesson.
In github I have just coded a whole new blog which in my opinion is a bit better than my old one. I think the layout is much more clear.
