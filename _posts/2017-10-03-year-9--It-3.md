    <td>This lesson I had to make sure I focused so I knew how to do the spreadsheets. I made sure I was paying attention and taking notes down in my brain. I did this well resulting in me being able to finish the work early and get on to some extension work.If you pay attention it really is not that difficult and is actually really cool seeing what the computer can do for you</td>
