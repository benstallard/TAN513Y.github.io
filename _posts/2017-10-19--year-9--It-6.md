    <td>Today was a good lesson. The lesson started alot of sign in issues but that was sorted out. After a while we started talking about Supercomputers which is "Mr Keens specialty" we went very deep into talking about supercomputers.We talked about a Chinese supercomputer called Sunway Taihu Light now ranked as the world's fastest,with a speed record with a rating of 93 petaflops per second. That's 93 quadrillion floating point operations per second (or 93 million billion).Mr keen demonstrated all the maths on the board to work out the speed,little did he know the speed was on the website right infront of us projected on the board. After talking about supercomputers we moved onto talking about social Engineering and how the thing that gives away the most information is yourself. People can spoof phone number and say they are working for a company only to manipulate the person actually working for the company. Pretty cool.Also how you can take screenshots of people webcams and record sound etc.
We talked a bit about spreadsheets and what more we need to add to over the half term I will add to my spreadsheet to improve it.Also I resized my Iframe!
