    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it.
Today was our second lesson use turtle and I feel like I have made good progress. I can now code in turtle python to write my name in any colour I want. Also I have found there is nearly an infinite amount of things such as turtle.write,turtle.color,turtle.turtle,nearly anything you could possibly think of.</td>
