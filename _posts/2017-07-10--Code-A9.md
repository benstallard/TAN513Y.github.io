    <td>I used lots of perseverance today during the lesson. I needed this skill a lot . This is because, I am getting further through the syllabus and it is a lot harder than at the beginning of the term. I am having to ask my friends more and thing a lot harder this means that I am thinking more logically and this is helping me learn more and that's what school is about, therefore these last few IT lessons have really been helping me learn and also have helped me like IT more.
I have been collaborating with my friends a lot because It is hard, this makes it more enjoyable and helps me get through the syllabus faster.
In github I have just coded in the read more sign however it is in the wrong place.

  <tr>
    <td>I could have talked a bit less even though it was on-topic to make sure I can get as far through as possible.
I need to work on concentrating on my own work and not helping other people as much. That means I will be able to get through even more work and maybe finish the course. Hove, this does not mean that I shouldn't work WITH my friends
