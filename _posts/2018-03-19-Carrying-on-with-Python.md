    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it.
Today was our third lesson use turtle and I feel like I have improved alot. Some people carried on with turtle but I went on to making a conversation with python which went very well.
Some of the code looked like this:
years = input("How old are you this year? \n")seconds = years * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60print "Oh my! You will be", seconds, "seconds old on your birthday!!"

    <td>There are not really any habits I need to work on apart from learning how to speak properly as I have not yet um mastered the skill to um not say "um" before every word.</td>
