At the beginning of this lesson we had to go into our stock sheet and add a code to every item and work out how much it had cost to make a certain item. We made a new column called "code" and one called "Cost Price." We deleted the contents out of our sale price column and entered a new number into our cost price column. We then made entered a number into a different cell on the spreadsheet. This number is from 0%-100% and will be how much profit you want to make.Then enter this into each of your sale price cells. We then created an separate price using VLOOKUP and a code box on the order form where you can choose what you want to order. Todays lesson was very confusing and did take a lot of trial and error. I had to try and try but eventually I got it right.It was all worth it in the end when we got our spreadsheet to work.
