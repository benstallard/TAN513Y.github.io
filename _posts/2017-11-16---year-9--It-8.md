    <td>Today was a good lesson. We started by refreshing our minds of what we did last lesson. Then we were taught to use the left right or right left command =RIGHT(left($E$19,E22+1),1) which was actually not confusing at all after you had got your head around it.I added this to my sheet pretty quickly, and also helped a few other people to do it. Then I advanced my learning by adding even for to my encryption sheet and I am now trying to get get the spreadsheet not to say the same letter repeated after your encryption has finished. Overall a good lesson.</td>
