    <td>Today was a cover lesson. However we did have set work to do. This lesson, we had to create three new sheets. This was hard at first because I could not remember how to do this. However, when I Refreshed my mind it became easier. We also had to name these sheets which I easily remembered from last time how to do. We had to make three new sheets, cost, sales and profit and loss. We were mainly working on solely the cost sheet today. We had to think of all of the costs that we would need and then find out how much it actually costs. Some of the costs we had were, workers, transport, how much electricity bills cost. The cost for the dodgy 8 mbs wifi. </td>
