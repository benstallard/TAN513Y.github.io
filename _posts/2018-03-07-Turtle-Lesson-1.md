    <td>Python is used everyday, you may not realise it, but many video games are created using python. Python is a programming language. To learn this language, we are using a website called repl.it.After signing up to repl.it, were given the task to create one of the simplest shapes there is, a triangle. First, we had to import turtle. This allowed us to have a little turtle on our screen that could draw lines. Using the turtle.forward(), turtle.backward(), turtle.left() and turtle.right() commands, we were able to move the turtle forwards, backwards, left and right. However, our task was to create a triangle. To do this I told my python to go forwards 100 pixels. Then, it turned left 60 degrees, then it went forward 100 and went left 60, then finally forward 100 and left 60.</td>
