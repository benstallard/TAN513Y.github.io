Year 9 IT Blog1

In the first lesson off year 9 we started off by learning how to turn on the computers, just kidding. We logged onto google spreadsheets and started off with some really basic things such as simple addition and multiplication.Also adding borders and colours to make it more productive to read not to look nice! We found out that on spreadsheets there are alot of ways to shortcut things to make it much less tiresome. For instance the some button then clicking on the certain boxes ( like C,4 or D,3) then pressing enter rather than writing out the number with the plus sign over and over again, because it takes much longer.Also if you do something to one number then drag it down it does the process for the other for you. We then advanced to creating some variables.I liked having the freedom of doing whatever we wanted to our tables because we got to see what would work and look well in our tables and what didn't look as nice. 
 I think the lesson was productive and I did not talk much. In summary, a great lesson to kick the year off.
